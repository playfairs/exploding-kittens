# Contributing to Exploding Kittens

## Project Vision

Welcome to Exploding Kittens! This is a 2D retro-style game in which you try to defuse as many kittens as possible before they explode.

## What We're Looking For

We're excited to welcome contributors who are passionate about:
- 2D game development
- Pixel art and 8-bit animations
- Chiptune and 8-bit sound design
- Game mechanics and level design
- Python game development

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and create your feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure the code you create follows the project's style
4. Submit a **pull request**

## Getting Started

1. Set up the development environment (Just a basic python environment for now)
2. Pick an issue from the issue tracker or suggest a new feature

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
- Keep functions and classes well-documented
- Write clear, concise commit messages

### I'm actually very bad at making sprites and sound effects, so if you want to help, that would be greatly appreciated :)
